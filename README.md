Eliminating guesswork
Through modelling, researchers can now predict the behaviour of some of the toughest cancers. Historically, oncologists have evaluated the prognosis of glioma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, on the basis of imaging and histological data. But that grading system didn't match up with reality, leading researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, to develop a mathematical model based on cell proliferation, invasion rates and changes in appearance. The model marries data from imaging studies with other models that incorporate blood-vessel growth patterns and tumour microenvironment, and was able to reproduce the growth patterns of each patient's specific tumour, and also reliably predict how it would progress — validating the method and improving on the existing grading.
Such models are starting to have an impact in the clinic. Alexander Anderson, a mathematical and computer modeller at the Moffitt centre and one of the team who worked on the glioma study, is using the model to investigate how cancer moves and spreads1. His lab has built computer models that focus on the changes to individual cancer cells. The models integrate information from different in vitro experiments with factors from in vivo environments to gain a better understanding of how cancer progresses one cell at a time. Anderson recently used clinical data from 650 prostate-cancer patients. Each patient's tumour was sliced multiple times and stained for 250 markers. He then integrated that biopsy information into a model, creating a digital version of the biopsy. When he and his colleagues move the model forward in time and space, they can create a predictive measure of whether a tumour will be aggressive.

And there's more. Mathematical models can also help researchers understand, and even prevent, tumour development. Larry Norton, an oncologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering centre, has devised a model of tumour growth based on nineteenth-century mathematics. The S-curve model showed that while tiny tumours barely grow at all, medium-sized tumours grow at a rapid pace, and large ones grow slowly. Norton and his colleagues hypothesized that the rate at which a tumour shrinks would also be proportional to its size, with large tumours shrinking slowly and small ones rapidly.

### Jekyll Themes

The conventional view of chemotherapy dosing held that, because tumour growth was exponential, each treatment killed the same amount of tumour. Norton, however, used his theory to argue that giving the same total amount of chemotherapy over a shorter period of time should improve the cure rate. Because his model showed that young tumours have the fastest growth rate, he said, the less time they had to regrow between treatments, the better the cure rate would be. Norton's idea was vindicated in 2002, when a large breast-cancer trial showed that giving chemotherapy every two weeks instead of every three lowered the risk of disease recurrence by 26% over three years, even though the cumulative dose was the same.

Norton makes the point that none of this would be possible without integrating biological growth models into treatment research. “The biological sciences have become anti-maths, and it's just not working. Researchers see lots and lots of facts, but they're not connecting them together,” he says. “It's like looking up at a starry sky and wondering how it worked. Only when Kepler and Newton came along did things fall into place.”

### Modelling
“The amount of understanding, knowledge and information we have at hand is huge, but it's too complicated to make sense of, in terms of what's going on in the system,” says Jasmin Fisher, a neuroimmunologist in the Programming Principles and Tools group at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, United Kingdom.
With all this information, it's possible to miss the cancer forest for the cellular trees, says biophysicist James Glazier, director of the Biocomplexity Institute at Indiana University in Bloomington. Researchers have tended to focus on genes and proteins, but to understand and fight the disease, it must be viewed as a system, rather than merely as a set of cellular activities. According to Glazier, the recent focus on genetics and pathways in individual cells has caused many researchers to neglect the systemic view. “No amount of information about what happens inside a single cell can ever tell you what a tissue is going to do,” he says. “Much of the information and complexity of tissues and life is embedded in the way cells talk to each other and the extracellular environment.”
