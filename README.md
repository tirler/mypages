Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
Eliminating guesswork
Through modelling, researchers can now predict the behaviour of some of the toughest cancers. Historically, oncologists have evaluated the prognosis of glioma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, on the basis of imaging and histological data. But that grading system didn't match up with reality, leading researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, to develop a mathematical model based on cell proliferation, invasion rates and changes in appearance. The model marries data from imaging studies with other models that incorporate blood-vessel growth patterns and tumour microenvironment, and was able to reproduce the growth patterns of each patient's specific tumour, and also reliably predict how it would progress — validating the method and improving on the existing grading.
Such models are starting to have an impact in the clinic. Alexander Anderson, a mathematical and computer modeller at the Moffitt centre and one of the team who worked on the glioma study, is using the model to investigate how cancer moves and spreads1. His lab has built computer models that focus on the changes to individual cancer cells. The models integrate information from different in vitro experiments with factors from in vivo environments to gain a better understanding of how cancer progresses one cell at a time. Anderson recently used clinical data from 650 prostate-cancer patients. Each patient's tumour was sliced multiple times and stained for 250 markers. He then integrated that biopsy information into a model, creating a digital version of the biopsy. When he and his colleagues move the model forward in time and space, they can create a predictive measure of whether a tumour will be aggressive.
